# Buckle Up

Project Duration: January 2022

Associated with: Texas A&M University
Overview

Buckle Up is a mobile application designed to enhance road safety by incentivizing responsible driving behavior through a comprehensive tracking and analysis system. The app tracks various aspects of a driver's behavior, including location, speed, acceleration, and deceleration. It then compares this data with established speed limits and traffic regulations set by the government. Based on this comparison, the app analyzes the driver's behavior and assigns points accordingly.
